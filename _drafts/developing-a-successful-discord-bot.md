  First and foremost, I can't guarantee that you will be successful if you follow this guide; these are simply the practices that have worked for me, and it is up to you to determine what you consider "successful." Next, I want to make it clear that this is a goal-oriented guide. While it can be very fun and entertaining to make a bot that does random tasks with little purpose, this guide is about creating a bot that is useful to people and adds (potentially-significant) value to communities.

## Part 1: Identify a Problem
  Before you even start _thinking_ about coding, you need to figure out what problem your bot is going to solve. To do this, you need to talk with people running servers, and with server members. You need to ask them what problems they face, which tasks they find themselves doing repeatedly, and what parts of the platform or server that they don't like.  
> `jagrosh:` Hello, Clyde! I've been an active member of your server for over a year now, and I really like how you have stuff set up. I'm working on a project and I'm trying to identify what kinds of problems large servers run into; do any problems come to mind, or anything that you find is annoying on a day-to-day basis?  
> `Clyde:` Oh, hey. Nothing critical comes to mind, although I guess it's kind of annoying when  
  When talking about these things, you might notice that people attempt to offer solutions instead of problems. For example, when discussing a lack of server activity, someone might say that a problem with their server is that "they don't have enough game bots." However, the real problem they have is the lack of activity; adding game bots is their idea of how to solve it. You need to find the real, underlying problem so that you can create a solution to that problem, and ideally a solution that anyone with that same problem can use.  
  Once you've talked to some people and found a problem you'd like to solve, go talk to some more people. See if these people have this problem as well! If they don't, figure out how they solved it

## Part 2: Outline a Solution

## Part 3: Prototype the Solution

## Part 4: Test and Improve

## Part 5: Get Feedback

## Part 6: Repeat
